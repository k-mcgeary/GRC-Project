# Governance, Risk, and Compliance Audit/Policy Practice

## Introduction
I undertook this project to get a better understanding of the less technical but always present side of cybersecurity, audits and policies. I believe everybody should have some exposure to what makes GRC tick because it is essential for organizations to navigate the complex landscape of cyber threats, regulatory requirements, and business objectives.

## Compliance and Audit Work
This section explained different cybersecurity frameworks, the importance of regulations, and what it means to be "compliant". These were some of the frameworks discussed as well as a brief description of them:

  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework -> a set of guidelines, standards, and best practices designed to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity posture through five core functions (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover)
    - Identify: This function involves understanding and managing the risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities. It includes activities such as asset management, risk assessment, and the establishment of a baseline of cybersecurity capabilities.
    - Protect: The Protect function focuses on implementing safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services. This includes activities such as access control, data protection, and the implementation of security measures to prevent or limit the             impact of a cybersecurity event.
    - Detect: This function involves the continuous monitoring and detection of cybersecurity events. Organizations should have processes and tools in place to identify and respond to incidents in a timely manner.
    - Respond: In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the Respond function guides organizations in developing and implementing an effective response plan. This includes communication plans, mitigation actions, and recovery strategies.
    - Recover: The Recover function focuses on restoring capabilities or services that were impaired during a cybersecurity incident. It includes activities such as recovery planning, improvements based on lessons learned, and communication with stakeholders.

  - SOC2 -> SOC 2 compliance is often a critical requirement for technology and cloud service providers, especially those handling sensitive customer information. It demonstrates a commitment to security and privacy best practices, providing clients with confidence in       the security of their data. Key points about SOC 2 include:
    
    - Trust Service Criteria: SOC 2 is based on the Trust Service Criteria, which include security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These criteria serve as the foundation for evaluating and reporting on the controls implemented by             service organizations.
    - Security: The security criterion is a fundamental component of SOC 2. It requires organizations to implement measures to protect against unauthorized access (both physical and logical) to sensitive information. This includes data centers, network infrastructure,         and information systems.
    - Availability: Availability focuses on ensuring that the organization's systems and services are available for operation and use as committed or agreed upon. This involves measures to prevent and recover from service interruptions or disruptions.
    - Processing Integrity: This criterion is about ensuring that system processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized. It involves controls to detect and prevent errors, fraud, or other irregularities in the processing of data.
    - Confidentiality: Confidentiality requires organizations to protect information designated as confidential from unauthorized access. It involves implementing measures to control access to sensitive data and prevent its disclosure.
    - Privacy: Privacy is an additional criterion introduced in SOC 2 in response to the increasing importance of data privacy. It addresses the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information.

  - NIST Risk Management Framework -> The NIST RMF is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various types of organizations and information systems. It emphasizes a continuous and iterative approach to risk management, ensuring that organizations are vigilant in           addressing evolving cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. Key components of the NIST Risk Management Framework include:
    - Prepare: This phase involves establishing the context and priorities for the risk management process. Organizations define their risk management strategy, assign responsibilities, and ensure that stakeholders are aware of their roles in the process.
    - Categorize: In this phase, information systems and the data they process are categorized based on their impact levels regarding confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This step helps in determining the appropriate level of security controls needed for each        system.
    - Select: Security controls are then selected based on the categorization of the information system. NIST provides a catalog of security controls that organizations can choose from to address specific risks. The selection is based on the identified security                requirements for each system.
    - Implement: Once security controls are selected, they need to be implemented effectively. This phase involves putting in place the chosen security controls and documenting how they are applied to the information system.
    - Assess: The effectiveness of the implemented security controls is assessed through testing and evaluation. This phase involves evaluating whether the controls are implemented correctly and are operating as intended to mitigate the identified risks.
    - Authorize: Based on the assessment results, the authorizing official makes a risk-based decision on whether to authorize the information system for operation. This decision considers the residual risks and the effectiveness of the security controls.
    - Monitor: Continuous monitoring is crucial for maintaining the security of the information system over time. This phase involves ongoing monitoring of security controls, regular security assessments, and the reporting of security status to relevant stakeholders.

This section also involved a brief audit spreadsheet that checked the MP-1 through MP-6 items in NIST 800-53 against a fake company. Part of the audit sheet is in the following image:

## Cybersecurity Risk Work
What exactly is risk? The likelihood and impact of adverse events or incidents that could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. I learned how important risk is to the life of someone working in GRC as well as the concept of threat modeling. 

Threat modeling in cybersecurity is a systematic approach to identifying and understanding potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks associated with a system, application, or network. It involves analyzing the components of a system, the interactions between them, and the potential security issues that may arise. The goal of threat modeling is to proactively assess and prioritize security risks, enabling organizations to implement effective countermeasures and enhance their overall security posture.

On the same spreadsheet that I did the sample audit, there are sections dedicated to quantifying the risk of the lack of or partially implemented controls the fake company used.

## Information Security Governance Work
During this last section I practiced a fundamental and crucial aspect of the GRC worker: policies, procedures, and standards. Writing policies, procedures, and standards for cybersecurity is essential for creating a robust and resilient cybersecurity program. These documents provide a roadmap for managing risks, ensuring compliance, and fostering a culture of security within the organization. They are integral to effective cybersecurity governance and contribute to the overall protection of information assets. I wrote a small practice policy for a made-up company to get a feel for the process.

## Conclusion
I was able to learn about the critical role GRC analysts play in the cybersecurity world through Gerald Auger of Simply Cyber. He made the information-heavy subject of governance, risk, and compliance easy enough to digest while not playing-down just how much there is about the field to learn. I hope one day to hold a position in GRC so I can get a deeper understanding of the less technical end of cybersecurity.
